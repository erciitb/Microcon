# Setting Up the PlayGround

## Prerequisites
For implementing Gemini AI response text-to-speech, ensure you have the following:

### Arduino Setup
- Latest Arduino version installed
- ESP32 Board Manager URL:
  ```
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
  ```
- Add the above link to additional board manager URL in the prefernce section in the IDE as shown in the below pic/.

Once esp32 board manager url is added , you can install the latest version of Esp32 libraies from the board manger as shown as the below image .( you might have to change this vrsion later for the upcomin gai chatbot activity , which is mentioned we in the readme file of teh respective  folders , ie speech to text and text to speech)


# Activity 

## Introducing sensors and cloud service

 for the frist part we will be using connecting a DHT11 sensor to esp32 and monitor its data remotly ....:)

 For that we need a cloud service , here we are going to use ardiuno cloud , 
- kindly to the this link and sign up for ardiuno cloud and install the ardiuno clint agent ( just follow on screen instructons)
- setup a device
- add a thing to this device
- upload teh code to the device
- finally monitor the data on dashboard

# AI Chat bot 

## text to speech + Gemini Ai ( if you got speacker follow this ) 

-  In this part ,you guys will follow the schmatic as shown below and complete the circuit 
-  once the circuit is done , upload this code
